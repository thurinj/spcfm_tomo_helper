# specfem_tomo_helper

`specfem_tomo_helper` is a program to generate the external tomography files required by specfem3D, from netCDF4 models available at [IRIS EMC](http://ds.iris.edu/ds/products/emc/). The intent of this code is to streamline the generation of these tomographic files.
The Area of Interest (AoI) of these tomographic files can be selected by direct input (in UTM coordinates as in specfem), or with a graphical user interface to select the AoI.

## Installation
### Installing Python and Dependencies

If you are well versed in Python, then the installation should not prove an issue; otherwise, please follow the advice here and download the [Anaconda Python distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) for your system. The code is working with the current version of Python (3.9 at the moment) but should be working with most of the older 3.x versions.

After downloading and installing Anaconda, update it with

```
$ conda update conda
```
Then create a new environment. You don’t have to, but using a new environment grants a clean separation between Python installations.

```
 $ conda create --name sth
 ```

 This will create a new conda environment based on the latest Python released (3.9) named `sth`. Activate it with

 ```
 $ conda activate sth
 ```

Remember to activate it every time you want to use `specfem_tomo_helper`. You can quit the `sth` environment with `conda deactivate`.

 Now install pip and cartopy with
 ```
 $ conda install pip cartopy pyproj
 ```

 ### Installing specfem_tomo_helper

 Now that the environment has been set up, you can download and install `specfem_tomo_helper` with

 ```
 $ git clone https://github.com/thurinj/specfem_tomo_helper.git
 $ cd specfem_tomo_helper/
 $ pip install -e .
 ```

Pip should install a few more dependencies while installing `specfem_tomo_helper` (namely `numpy`, `scipy`, `pyproj`, `pandas` ,and `netCDF4`).


### Running specfem_tomo_helper
From here, you can move to the examples folder, where you can try 2 examples for 2D and 3D interpolation.
In both instances, the mandatory user inputs are `dx` (easting sampling in m), `dy` (northing sampling in m), `dz` (depth sampling in m), `zmin` and `zmax` (min and max depth in km, with positives upward).

#### Bilinear interpolation
The first should be used for very dense models where trilinear interpolation would be too expensive to use. The included example is the SCEC south Californian model [EMC-CVM_H_v15_1](http://ds.iris.edu/ds/products/emc-cvm_h_v15_1/). This example performs the interpolation over a cartesian grid at each depth slice defined in the netCDF model. This example proposes two user modes. 1) directly input spcefem3D Mesh_Par_File latitude and longitude informations to select the interpolation bounds (`mode = 1` in the script). 2) interactive graphical user interface based on `matplotlib` and `cartopy` (`mode = 2` in the script).

You can run the trilinear interpolator code with
```
$ python example_specfem_tomo_helper.py
```
The mode variable can be changed in the source code depending on users' preference.

#### Trilinear interpolation
The latter example (3D interpolation) is the option to favor for sparse models. It was tested on 1° lat/lon and 0.5° lat/lon resolution models and proved to be perfectly appropriate.
The test model included is the [CSEM_Europe_2019.12.01](http://ds.iris.edu/ds/products/emc-csem_europe/).

You can run the trilinear interpolator code with
```
$ python example_specfem_tomo_helper_3D.py
```

### What's coming next - Contribution ideas
`specfem_tomo_helper` has only the most basic features so far. It functions with two modes, namely a bilinear and a trilinear interpolation mode, depending on the spatial sampling of the original netCDF model to interpolate.


There are currently two features that would make the code more complete and would be great additions. Any help contributing to the code, or specifically with these two items are welcome:

#### Rotated domain
As of now, the regular interpolation grid can only be along the N-E directions. It would be desirable to be able to interpolate onto any rotated cartesian grid, such that the model size can be optimized to save on numerical modeling costs afterward.

#### Multiple tomographic files
The current bilinear interpolator only outputs a single tomographic file with regular x, y and z sampling. However, on very dense models and large modeling domains, the `tomography_file.xyz` can rapidly grow in size and become impractical to work with.
To mitigate that issue, the model domain can be split in several vertical chunks with varying spatial sampling (with the chunks becoming coarser with depth), and read as several distinct tomographic files by specfem3D.
